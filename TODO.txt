Inventory:
(Fix filtering: do nothing to sinv array, just ignore filtered-out stuff in Step and Draw)
Add multiple pages
Add Shields and Gems
Add gun comparison

Add multiple Characters, with their own loadout + stats

Rework gun generation - generate parts only and then have a "lookup" function which applies each part's effect separately

Rewrite projectile code - have Pattern objects handle drawing,collision,movement for all bullets they create

Add proper controls handling (global vars + controller support)

Fix inventory bug which crashes when inv is full

Convert all UI to use Draw GUI event
(and then allow user to change resolution)
