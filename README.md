# looter-hell
Combines bullet hell gameplay with incremental looter progression



# bug log
-BUG: Sometimes freezes forever when switching weapons, stuck in an infinite loop probably  
-BUG: Dropped guncards now way too wide  
-BUG: Fullscreen causes the game to shit its pants. Either fix or make borderless windowed the only option  
-BUG: Inventory breaks if it is completely full (semi-fixed but should look into the actual cause)
