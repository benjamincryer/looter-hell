-Added a quick equip cycle button (Ctrl default)

-Edited all gun sprites so that textures slightly affect the outline too (not just black outline on everything)

-Fixed loadwidth bug; now properly places inventory next to loadout based on widest text, not just width of the last text lol
-Held gun now properly updates if the gun in current loadout position is changed

-BUG: Burst fire doesn't always fire the correct number of shots
-BUG: Burst fire also doesn't work if you hold shoot before the end of the reload period

-BUG: Enemy HP goes into negatives before death
-BUG: Inventory breaks if it is completely full
